      <p>I'm Rajdeep Singh Devra, a passionate PhD scholar in Mechanical Engineering at IIT Gandhinagar. As one of the founding members of the Anveshanam Club, I have been deeply involved in shaping its journey from its humble beginnings as a hobby group to becoming an officially recognized research society at IITGN in February 2022. Currently, I proudly serve as the Club Secretary. I envision creating a supportive research community that fosters continuous learning and exploration. When not busy with research, I enjoy playing badminton and endurance running.</p>
